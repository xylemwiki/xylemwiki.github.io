        <p>
            Xylem games is a Dominion group who created the expansion <i class="b">Abyss</i>. Their other projects included <i class="b">Oasis</i>, <i class="b">Rome</i>, and <i class="b">Legends</i>. Abyss is the 16th expansion to Dominion. Rising Sun is the most recent expansion and is the 17th. Xylem games follows a modified numbering scheme, because <i class="b">Abyss</i> released before <i class="b">Rising Sun</i>. <br><br>
            Xylem is composed of 4 people who all create expansions to Dominion. These four people being, <i class="b">Sean C.</i>, <i class="b">Liam G.</i>, <i class="b">Weston S.</i>, and <i class="b">Chris M.</i> Chris was the latest member making his first full contributions for <i class="b">Dominion Legends</i>. The other 3 created <i class="b">Abyss</i>, and <i class="b">Oasis</i> together, and <i class="b">Rome</i> was made by <i class="b">Weston S.</i> To see who created each card check... For <i class="b">Legends, Abyss, Oasis</i>: the Bottom Right, For <i class="b">Rome, Alchemy 2E, or Removed Cards</i>: the Bottom Right on most cards or the Bottom Left.

        <h2>Sean C.</h2>
        <p>
            Sean C. has worked on each of the expansions made by Xylem, and was the founder of <i class="b">Xylem Games</i>. Sean began creating custom board games with some of his many projects including <i class="b">Tops TCG</i> which eventually became <i class="b">MLB Combat</i>. Sean was the creator of <i class="b">Marine cards</i> from <i class="b">Abyss</i> and led the sets development. <br><br>
            Sean primarily serves as the main card <i class="b">checks and balances</i> editor, and does also create many of the cards. He primarily served as a creative lead for <i class="b">Abyss</i>, but played a slightly smaller role in <i class="b">Legends</i>.  
        </p>
        <h2>Liam G.</h2>
        <p>
           Liam is the founder of <i class="b">Legends</i> and was the creative lead for that set. Liam has contributed to every <i class="b">Xylem</i> set expect for <i class="b">Rome</i>. Liam was the brains behind <i class="b">Conquer cards</i> and the <i class="b">Dragons</i>. His original development name for <i class="b">Legends</i> was <i class="b">Magic Dominion</i> with the subtext of "make magic." <br><br>
    Liam created <i class="b">Wealth of the Sea</i> a <i class="b">Treasure card</i> from <i class="b">Abyss</i> and was one of his first contributions to <i class="b">Xylem</i>. Most cards created by Liam pass through testing and fixing by Sean before being included due to the fact that many cards Liam creates are broken. See <i class="b">King of Dragons</i> from <i class="b">Legends</i>. 
        </p>
    <h2>Weston S.</h2>
    <p>
    Weston is primarily a coder focused on Svelte and HTMl and is responsible for the whole <i class="b">Xylem Wiki</i>. Weston has contributed to every <i class="b">Xylem</i> set and was the creator of <i class="b">Rome</i>, and <i class="b">Oasis</i> both of which were discontinued.<br><br>
    Weston created the slight majority of cards in <i class="b">Dominion Legends</i> and was responsible for the creation of the <i class="b">Instant</i> class of cards which was a spiritual predecessor to the modern <i class="b">Shadow cards</i> found in <i class="b">Dominion Rising Sun</i>.

    </p>
    <h2>Chris M.</h2>
    <p>
    Chris was the last member to join the team making his first full contributions in 3 of the cards from <i class="b">Legends</i>. Chris acted previous to that as an idea giver rather than actually making cards. <br><br>
    Chris also unmeaning mentioned the idea of <i class="b">Set - Aside Coffers</i> which was a slip up in rhetoric stemming from a limited understanding of the functionality of <i class="b">Coffers</i>. Chris favors the <i class="b">Adventures</i> and <i class="b">Nocturne</i> sets.
